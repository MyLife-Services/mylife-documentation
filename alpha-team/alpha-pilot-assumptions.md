Hello Gina Paola!

As you identified, we need to assess and validate our assumptions and hypotheses with real users. This is where I can use your help developing what those assumptions are we aim to confirm.

If you could start us off with an outline of what this section would look like and fill in as much as you can from the current MVP and the revived Figma document I sent you that would be _incredibly_ helpful. It's very useful to the project as well to have additional eyes than mine on the matter!

**Note**: Let's be careful not to include out-of-system links here (like Figma documents) until we understand the public sharing ramifications (i.e., I don't want people to be able to write and version anonymously into infinity)
