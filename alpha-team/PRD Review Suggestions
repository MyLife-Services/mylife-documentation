After reviewing the PRD, I came up with the below improvement recommendations that will help build our value proposition.

Customer Segment: Elderly & Stories in Jeopardy – This is where William’s user persona fits 
Use Case - Digital Self Preservation: Able to write his biography in his own terms while maintaining his sense of identity → Arranging My Digital Legacy
USe Case - Life Story documentation: Preserves personal histories for future generations. --> A Grandparent’s Legacy for Future Generations
Use Case - Memory Stimulation: Aids in recalling and sharing past experiences. → Real-time tracking of mental exercises that can help protect against age-related losses

Customer Segment: Self–Awareness/Self Education-This where Louis’ user persona fits. Recommendation: lets indicate he is a widower 
Use Case - Family Sharing: Facilitates sharing memories with family members → Life lessons and wisdom
Use Case - Storytelling: Encourages sharing experiences with others by making them more relatable and using a more engaging tone →Stories and histories passed down through generations
Use Case - Daily Journal Keeping: Promotes self-expression → Personal growth and self-exploration

Customer Segment: Tech Advocates and AI Enthusiasts- This is a bit too generic- It seems we are trying to throw a wide to catch as many users as possible. 
My suggestion is that we break this customer segment into Tech Savvy Families/Parents - This where Anna fits. 
Use Case - Family Events: Documents vacations, birthdays, and special occasions → Capturing Milestones and Achievements
Use Case - Digital Self Creation → Planting the seeds on how to be remembered → Preserving a Lifetime of Memories
Use Case - Children/Parent/Family Hobbies: Documents the hobbies/activities that family members pursue → Documentation of hobbies and passions

Customer Segment: Tech Resourceful Gen Z Teenarges (15 to 18 years old)  instead of Tech Advocates and AI Enthusiasts
Use Case - School Projects: Guides in organizing and completing assignments → My Research Projects
Use Case - Genealogy:  Helps build and maintain family histories → Creating a Family Tree
Use Case - Identify Exploration: Facilitates searching and capturing answers to the question "who am I?" → Capturing the Evolution of Identity


* Additional Risks to consider:
Technological AI limitations - Addressed by continuous AI model training and updates
Data security-Ensured by robust encryption compliance with privacy laws 
ChatGPT riks: Let’s brainstorm on the potential risks and how we will mitigate them. The main risk that keeps coming to my mind is chatgpt being down. 

* Functional Requirements - Let’s include the AI functional requirements too

* Data Requirements - Let’s identify the user data requirements vs AI data requirements
