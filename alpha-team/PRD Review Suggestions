* Additional Risks to consider:
Technological AI limitations - Addressed by continuous AI model training and updates
Data security-Ensured by robust encryption compliance with privacy laws 
ChatGPT riks: Let’s brainstorm on the potential risks and how we will mitigate them. The main risk that keeps coming to my mind is chatgpt being down. 

* Functional Requirements - Let’s include the AI functional requirements too

* Data Requirements - Let’s identify the user data requirements vs AI data requirements
