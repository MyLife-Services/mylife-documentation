## Subject: MyLife Alpha Project Still Here and Moving Forward!

Dear [Participantâ€™s Name],

We hope this message finds you well. We wanted to reach out and extend my apologies for the delay in following up after our last correspondence.

### Update and Next Steps

We are still finalizing some critical aspects before we can launch the alpha phase of the MyLife platform. Specifically, we are seeking a volunteer Project Lead to assist as the point person in running the alpha program. This role involves a time investment of 6-12 hours per week for a minimum of 5 weeks. We have posted this position on LinkedIn and would appreciate any referrals or applications from interested candidates.

The Project Lead will engage with approximately 30 alpha users, manage weekly exercises, collect user feedback, and organize group sessions. This volunteer opportunity offers a unique chance to lead the evaluation of a cutting-edge AI-powered platform, gain invaluable experience in project management, and make a lasting impact on the preservation of human stories and memories.

If you know anyone who would like to gain experience on the cutting edge of AI-software development, [please point them to our application!](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3949611701/?refId=sFdqaoSOSySS%2BBmgKxeVaw%3D%3D&trackingId=sFdqaoSOSySS%2BBmgKxeVaw%3D%3D)

### How We Plan to Proceed

We have designed a specific four-week alpha program to thoroughly test the MyLife alpha platform:

- **Week 1:** Confirmation and MyLife member registration online. This initial phase ensures that all consenting participants are registered and familiarized with the platform.
- **Week 2:** Collect memories and store them with your biographer bot. Members will gather and upload their cherished memories to the platform.
- **Week 3:** Users will refine and organize their memories with the help of our AI tools.
- **Week 4:** Relive memories and share them through the platform.

### Gratitude and Your Continued Support

We deeply appreciate your patience, enthusiasm, and willingness to be part of this journey. Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you will have the opportunity to both opt-in and opt-out in a private manner, ensuring your comfort and preference.

Once our project lead is on board and we have everything in place, we will send another email detailing the process and next steps. We are almost at go-time, and we are thrilled to have you on board.

Thank you once again for your understanding and support.

Warm regards,
