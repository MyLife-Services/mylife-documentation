# MyLife Second Outreach Email to Alpha Participants

## 20240614

## Subject: MyLife Alpha Project Still Here and Moving Forward!

Dear [Participant’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and extend my apologies for the delay in following up after our last correspondence.

Before proceeding, I felt it was essential to ensure that everything was perfectly aligned and ready. Imagine standing at the departure gate, just moments before boarding, and suddenly feeling the need to check that you have everything you need for the journey ahead—spectacles, wallet, and all other essentials. I needed to make sure that everything was in place to ensure a smooth and successful experience for all of us.

What I realized is that I need to focus on the platform services and would greatly benefit from the aid of a point person who could ensure the journey was secure for all of you. As we prepare for this adventure, it has become clear how unique MyLife is among the new raft of AI products being developed.

### Update and Next Steps

We are still finalizing some critical aspects before we can launch the alpha phase of the MyLife platform. Specifically, we are seeking a volunteer Project Lead to assist as the point person in running the alpha program. This role involves a time investment of 6-12 hours per week for a minimum of 5 weeks. We have posted this position on LinkedIn and would appreciate any referrals or applications from interested candidates.

Finding the right Project Lead for our alpha release is critical for the success of MyLife. The insights and feedback gathered during this phase will directly influence the development and refinement of our platform, ensuring that it meets the needs and expectations of our users. The Project Lead will engage with approximately 30 alpha users, manage weekly exercises, collect user feedback, and organize group sessions. This volunteer opportunity offers a unique chance to lead the evaluation of a cutting-edge AI-powered platform, gain invaluable experience in project management, and make a lasting impact on the preservation of human stories and memories.  If you know anyone who would like to gain experience on the cutting edge of AI-software development, [please point them to our application!](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3949611701/?refId=sFdqaoSOSySS%2BBmgKxeVaw%3D%3D&trackingId=sFdqaoSOSySS%2BBmgKxeVaw%3D%3D)

### What This Means for You

We have designed a specific four-week alpha program to thoroughly test the MyLife alpha platform:

- **Week 1:** Confirmation and MyLife member registration online. This initial phase ensures that all participants are registered and familiarized with the platform.
- **Week 2:** Collect memories and store them to review with the biographer bot. Participants will gather and upload their cherished memories to the platform.
- **Week 3:** Curate your memories with direct edit, bot assistance, and prompts. Users will refine and organize their memories with the help of our AI tools.
- **Week 4:** Relive memories and share them with others. This final phase allows participants to experience their preserved memories in the third person as well as share them with others.

### Gratitude and Your Continued Support

I deeply appreciate your patience, enthusiasm, and willingness to be part of this journey. Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you will have the opportunity to both opt-in and opt-out in a private manner, ensuring your comfort and preference.

Once our project lead is on board and we have everything in place, I will send another email detailing the process and next steps. We are almost at go-time, and I am thrilled to have you on board.

Thank you once again for your understanding and support.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
