# Alpha Team Initial Outreach Email

## Subject: Welcome to MyLife, Alpha Team ${ firstName }!

Hello ${ firstName }, our newest _MyLife_ Alpha Team Member!
 
First of all, _thank you_ for being a part of what is certainly to be a wonderous journey.
Secondly, please forgive the lateness of our reply. We have not forgotten about you and we couldnâ€™t be more proud to share that the _MyLife_ member platform is nearly ready for our first Alpha Team.

_Why the delay?_

AI models, we rely thus far on OpenAI, have been changing rapidly, and we have incorporated these enhancements **into** the Alpha version of the **_MyLife_ Platform**!

You may [still chat with **Q**](https://humanremembranceproject.org), our intelligent platform agent, on the live site, and [here is a link to our platform announcement and informational article](https://medium.com). You will hear from our **Alpha Team Coordinator** again in a week with next steps, where we will introduce you to the alpha tutorial and provide access to your biography team of ai-assistants who will help you tell your stories, for now and _forever_.

Thank you again for joining us on this journey, it's bound to be like _nothing_ you've experienced before,
