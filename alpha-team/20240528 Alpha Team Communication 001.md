# Alpha Team Initial Outreach Email

## Subject: Welcome to MyLife, Alpha Team ${ firstName }!

Hello ${ firstName }, our newest _MyLife_ Alpha Team Member!
 
First of all, _thank you_ for being a part of what is certain to be a wonderous journey.
Secondly, we appreciate your patience. We have not forgotten about you and we couldnâ€™t be more proud to share that the _MyLife_ member platform is nearly ready for our first Alpha Team.

_Why the delay?_

AI models have been changing rapidly, and we have incorporated these enhancements **into** the Alpha version of the **_MyLife_ Platform**!

You may [still chat with **Q**](https://humanremembranceproject.org), our intelligent platform agent, on the live site, and [here is a link to our platform announcement and informational article](https://medium.com). 

What _MyLife_ is asking of our Alpha Members:

- **4 weeks** participation, where you will engage with the MyLife with an anticipated launch date of **Monday, June 10<sup>th</sup>**
- At the start of each week, your coordinator will send activity prompts to be completed that week. While you are free to enjoy the system as much as you like, the prompts themselves should take **no more than 1 hour** each week to accomplish and provide basic feedback.
- At the end of the initial four weeks, we will have a **short** group or individual session to go over results and feedback.
- After which you will continue to have access to the MyLife Member Services Platform with no further obligations, though you will have first-rights to continue on with us for the beta release!

You will hear from our **Alpha Team Coordinator** again in a week with next steps, where we will introduce you to the alpha tutorial and provide access to the team of ai-assistants who will help you tell your stories, for now and forever.

Thank you again for joining us on this incredible journey--it's bound to be like nothing you've experienced before,
