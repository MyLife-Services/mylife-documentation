# MyLife Initial Outreach Email to Alpha Participants

## Subject: Welcome to MyLife, Alpha Team, ${firstName}!

Hello ${firstName}, and welcome to the _MyLife Alpha Team_!

First of all, thank you for joining us on what promises to be a remarkable journey. We deeply appreciate your patience and enthusiasm as we prepare to launch the _MyLife_ member platform for our Alpha Team.

**Why the delay?**

AI models have been evolving rapidly, and we have integrated these advancements into the Alpha version of the _MyLife_ Platform to enhance your experience.

### What can you do in the meantime?

You can still chat live with [_MyLife_'s AI-Agent **_Q_** on our homepage](https://humanremebranceproject.org), our intelligent platform agent, on the live site. Additionally, here is a [link to our platform announcement and informational article](https://ewbj.medium.com/mylife-we-save-your-life-480a80956a24).

### What _MyLife_ asks of our Alpha Members

- **Participation Duration:** 4 weeks, starting _Monday, June 10th_.
- **Weekly Engagement:** At the start of each week, your coordinator will send activity prompts. Prompts should take no more than 1 hour each week to complete and provide basic feedback. Beyond that, alpha members are free to use all aspects of the platform.
- **Feedback Session:** At the end of the initial four weeks, we will have a short group or individual session to review results and gather your feedback.
- **Post-Alpha Access:** You will continue to have access to the MyLife Member Services Platform with no further obligations. Plus, you'll have first-rights to continue with us for the _beta release_!

### Next Steps:

You will hear from our **Alpha Team Coordinator** again in a week with further instructions. This will include an introduction to the alpha tutorial and access to a team of AI assistants who will help you tell your stories, for now and forever.

Thank you again for joining us on this incredible journey. It’s bound to be like _nothing_ you’ve experienced before.
