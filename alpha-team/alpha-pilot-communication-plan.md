## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This communication plan is designed to ensure that all volunteer members on project staff as well as pilot _members_ are well-informed, actively engaged, and have clear expectations throughout the pilot phase. Our goal is to foster a collaborative environment where feedback is easily shared and acted upon, ensuring a successful alpha launch and allowing members to begin capturing and editing their memories.

## 2. Timeline and Milestones

- **Communication Schedule:** A detailed timeline outlining key communication touchpoints, including onboarding, regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and feature announcements.
- **Milestone Tracking:** Transparent updates to members on key product developments, including feature rollouts and progress towards pilot goals.

## 3. Channels and Timing of Communication

- **Primary Channels:** Email and a dedicated Slack/Teams channel for real-time updates and discussions.
- **Timing:** Regular updates will be sent bi-weekly(if not weekly), with additional communications as needed for milestone achievements or critical announcements.

## 4. Engagement Activities and Activity Plan

- **Surveys and Polls:** Regular surveys and polls focused on gathering qualitative insights from users regarding key MyLife activities such as Registration, Login, Sharing Memories, Editing Memories, and Reliving Memories.
- **Engagement Events:** Virtual Q&A sessions and webinars to keep users engaged and informed.

## 5. Feedback Mechanisms

- **Feedback Collection:** Structured feedback sessions after each milestone/release, supplemented by continuous feedback options via slack channels and github issues. Feedback will be prioritized based on impact and feasibility, ensuring the most critical issues are addressed promptly.
- **Actionable Insights:** Regular summaries of feedback and the corresponding actions taken to address user concerns. Each action will be converted in to a github ticket to track the progress of the action.

## 6. Support and Resources
