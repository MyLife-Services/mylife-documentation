Hi all!

Over this holiday weekend or at your earliest convenience thereafter, we would love to get your account created in the MyLife system that you can all have its abilities at your disposal, as we become the test candidates for our pre-pilot we'll be running over the next week with the Board and you!

We'll have some easy, quick and basic tasks for you to perform next week to prepare us and the product for committing to engaging the alpha team!

We'll begin in that vein. For any who haven't registered for accounts in MyLife, here's how to get started!

- [ ] Go to our homepage at [humanremembranceproject.org](https://humanremembranceproject.org/)
- [ ] Q, our intelligence greets you, so please respond in the lower chat text region with something like: `register me!` and hit the **submit** button
- [ ] Q should then give you an outline of instructions of information MyLife requires in order to build your account: your _name_, _email_, and the preferred starting name of your avatar, who will be your MyLife overarching AI assistant
  - **note**: there is no requirement to put all of this data in at once, you could interact with one piece of data with each "submit" if you like. Please be alert for spelling errors _in this one case_ as it might interrupt the confirmation of your account, especially in email. A mistake in the avatar name won't matter, but it's likely that mispelling your own name might stick in your account for a bit, as I haven't written a direct self-service mechanic to update.

From there, I will follow up with a personal validation link in a private `Slack` message with instructions on how to validate your account, which is also a very quick process.

I couldn't be more excited to have you all on this fun and extraordinary journey! Looking forward!
