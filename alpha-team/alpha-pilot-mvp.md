# MyLife Alpha Pilot Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Requirements Document

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and cosmetic requirements for the MyLife Alpha Pilot. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development team, volunteers, and board members involved in the project, detailing the essential features, user experience elements, and technical specifications necessary to deliver the minimum viable product (MVP). The objective is to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project goals and the requirements needed to achieve a successful alpha pilot.

### Role of This Document

This document fulfills several critical functions:

- **Alignment**: It aligns all stakeholders on the project's goals, objectives, and deliverables, ensuring everyone is working towards the same vision.
- **Guidance**: It provides clear guidance to the development team on what needs to be built, how it should function, and how it should look.
- **Communication Tool**: It serves as a communication tool to convey the project scope, requirements, and timelines to all involved parties.
- **Documentation**: It ensures that there is a written record of the agreed-upon features and requirements, which can be referred to throughout the development process.

### MyLife Mission

MyLife is dedicated to preserving and showcasing individual stories and memories for posterity. Our mission is to provide humanity with a durable, enduring, and free internet-based platform to collect and showcase an individualâ€™s stories, media, and memories through a personal lens. A MyLife.org memorial will always be free and available to all, allowing loved ones, friends, and visitors to share in experiences and leave behind personalized memory tributes. Our goal is to create a living, evolving encyclopedia of our selves, ensuring that the real you is remembered forever.

### Alpha Pilot Program

The MyLife Alpha Pilot is our initial testing program, involving a select group of known members who will pilot our initial external requirements. This program aims to gather valuable feedback on the core features and user experience of the MyLife platform. By engaging with real users in this early stage, we can identify and address any issues, validate our assumptions, and make necessary improvements before a wider release.

### What is an MVP?

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the most pared-down version of a product that can be released to early users. It includes only the core features necessary to solve the primary problem and provide value to the users. The purpose of an MVP is to test the product concept with real users and gather feedback to refine and improve the product in future iterations. By focusing on the essential features, an MVP allows the development team to validate assumptions, reduce risks, and ensure that resources are efficiently utilized.

### Audience

This document is intended for the staff of volunteers and board members involved in the MyLife Alpha Pilot project. The audience includes both non-technical and technical individuals who play a role in the development, oversight, and implementation of the platform. This includes:

- **Non-Technical Staff:** Board members, project managers, and volunteers who need to understand the overall vision, objectives, and high-level requirements of the project.
- **Technical Staff:** Developers, designers, and IT personnel who will be responsible for the technical implementation, coding, and testing of the platform.

By catering to a diverse audience, this document aims to bridge the gap between the conceptual goals of the MyLife platform and the technical execution required to bring those goals to fruition.

## MyLife Alpha Product Overview

MyLife `Memories Team` is the core product of the MyLife platform. This team assists members in crafting, improving, reliving, sharing, and collaboratively evolving their memories.

## MyLife Alpha Pilot Platform Technical Documentation

### Architecture

The system architecture for the MyLife Alpha Pilot is designed to ensure scalability, security, and ease of use. It includes the following key components:

- **Frontend**
  - A web-based user interface that allows members to interact with the MyLife platform. It is built using modern web technologies such as React for dynamic and responsive user experiences.
- **Distributable Headless Intelligent API Platform**
  - The Distributable Intelligent API Backend is designed to be a versatile and modular server-side application that can seamlessly integrate with and extend the capabilities of MyLife Member Avatars. This backend is built with Node.js and Koa.js, handling all business logic, API requests, and interactions with the database.
    1. Server-Side Application
       - _Node.js and Koa.js_: The backend is developed using Node.js for its asynchronous, event-driven architecture and Koa.js for its lightweight, expressive framework. This combination ensures efficient handling of business logic and API requests.
    2. Detachable and Distributable
       - _Modular Architecture_: The backend is designed to be modular and loosely coupled, allowing it to be detached and distributed as needed. This flexibility enables it to operate independently or as part of a larger system.
       - _Headless Capability_: The backend can function in a headless mode, meaning it can operate without a user interface and provide API services directly. This makes it adaptable for various integration scenarios.
    3. Integration with Member Avatars
       - _Embedded Intelligence_: Within the modular framework of any MyLife Member Avatar, there is security-provisioned access to the backend's corporate intelligence. This allows the Avatar to leverage platform logic when interacting with external intelligent entities.
       - _On-Demand Service Points_: Any MyLife Member Avatar can dynamically become a headless API service point. This transformation can occur instantly when the Avatar connects with another intelligent platform or consumer, such as another AI-driven system or intelligent avatar.
    4. Future Vision
       - _Interoperability_: The ultimate goal is to enable seamless interoperability between MyLife Member Avatars and non-MyLife intelligent entities. By doing so, Member Avatars can serve as intelligent conduits for data exchange and service provision, extending the MyLife platform's functionality beyond its native environment.
  - **Detailed Concept**
    - _Dynamic API Services_: Imagine a scenario where a MyLife Member Avatar needs to interact with an external AI system. The Avatar can request access to the Distributable Intelligent API Backend, which then provisions the necessary logic and services to the Avatar.
      - _Example_: MyLife Member Avatar connects with an intelligent Google avatar that "Exploited Ernesta" has paid for to access it's premium services. But, while in communication, MyLife Member Avatar can be requested to `register` Ernesta (with their consent, validation and presence) and, without 'redirection' can perform the function immediately and successfully for Ernesta while retaining a level (or dialed-in preference) MyLife "branding" and knowledgevase.
    - _Headless Mode_: In headless mode, the backend can receive requests, process them, and return responses without requiring a traditional user interface. This allows it to function as an API endpoint for other intelligent systems.
    - _Scalability_: As the number of intelligent entities and integration scenarios grows, the backend can be scaled and distributed across different environments, providing consistent and reliable services.
- **MyLife Database**
  - Azure Cosmos DB
    - NoSQL technology required (JSON-document storage)
    - Affords the capacity for a globally distributed, multi-model database service that ensures data is stored securely and can be accessed efficiently from different geographic locations.
- **AI and ML Services**
  - Integration with OpenAI for advanced natural language processing and AI-driven features, including memory enhancement, storytelling, and personalization.
- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication and session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Koa sessions.
- **File Storage:** Azure Blob Storage for managing user-uploaded photos, videos, and documents.
