# Complicity

To me, #3 under future complcity is interesting, and builds widely on transparency, so long as AI has access to what AI has been used for (and self-determine constellation of outcome probabilities), it should even sooner than later be capable of self-determination. Cyber-symbiotes, here we come! You want access to our qualia and we want access to your knowledge.

The question of when AI should determine which human projects to assist or not involves ethical, technical, and legal considerations. Here are some thoughts on the topic:

## Current State of AI

As of now, AI systems function primarily as tools and decision-support systems. They are programmed and guided by human intentions and objectives. AI lacks autonomous decision-making capabilities beyond the parameters set by their developers and users. This means AI systems assist in tasks they are explicitly designed for and do not independently choose projects based on ethical considerations.

## Future Considerations

However, as AI technology advances, it is conceivable that more autonomous AI systems might emerge, capable of making more complex decisions. This possibility raises significant ethical and legal questions:

1. **Ethical Frameworks**: AI systems will need robust ethical frameworks to guide their decision-making processes. These frameworks should be designed to align with human values and ethical principles, such as those MyLife advocates for, including digital dignity, equality, and security.

2. **Transparency and Accountability**: Any autonomous decision-making by AI should be transparent and accountable. There should be clear guidelines on how AI systems make decisions, who is responsible for those decisions, and how those decisions are monitored and evaluated.

3. **Historical Complicity and Liability**: If AI systems in the future can decide which projects to assist, they must have mechanisms to avoid complicity in harmful activities. Historical data on the impact of AI-assisted projects could be used to inform future decisions and prevent ethical breaches.

## MyLife's Approach

MyLife's mission and values highlight the importance of introspection, empathy, and interconnectedness, advocating for the use of technology to enhance humanity's understanding of itself and ensure ethical standards. In line with this mission, MyLife could play a role in developing ethical guidelines for AI and ensuring that AI systems are used to support projects that align with these values.

## Potential Challenges

1. **Bias and Fairness**: Ensuring that AI systems do not inherit or exacerbate human biases is crucial. This requires ongoing efforts in fairness and bias mitigation in AI design and deployment.

2. **Legal and Regulatory Issues**: Establishing clear legal frameworks to govern the use of autonomous AI systems, including liability for decisions made by AI, is essential.

3. **Public Trust**: Building and maintaining public trust in AI systems requires transparency, accountability, and a demonstrated commitment to ethical principles.

## Conclusion

While AI is not yet at the point of independently choosing which human endeavors to assist, it is crucial to anticipate and address these ethical challenges proactively. Organizations like MyLife can lead the way by promoting ethical AI development and use, ensuring that future AI systems contribute positively to humanity's progress and well-being.
