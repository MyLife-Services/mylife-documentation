WE ASSIGNED YOU AN EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER 
Thank you for applying for an Employer Identification Number (EIN). We assigned you 
EIN 87-4244200. This EIN will identify you, your business accounts, tax returns, and 
documents, even if you have no employees. Please keep this notice in your permanent 
records. 
Taxpayers request an EIN for their business. Some taxpayers receive CP575 notices when 
another person has stolen their identity and are opening a business using their information. 
If you did not apply for this EIN, please contact us at the phone number or address listed
on the top of this notice. 
When filing tax documents, making payments, or replying to any related correspondence, 
it is very important that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown 
above. Any variation may cause a delay in processing, result in incorrect information in 
your account, or even cause you to be assigned more than one EIN. If the information is 
not correct as shown above, please make the correction using the attached tear-off stub 
and return it to us. 
Based on the information received from you or your representative, you must file 
the following forms by the dates shown. 
Form 1120 04/15/2022
If you have questions about the forms or the due dates shown, you can call us at 
the phone number or write to us at the address shown at the top of this notice. If you 
need help in determining your annual accounting period (tax year), see Publication 538, 
Accounting Periods and Methods. 
We assigned you a tax classification (corporation, partnership, etc.) based on 
information obtained from you or your representative. It is not a legal determination 
of your tax classification, and is not binding on the IRS. If you want a legal 
determination of your tax classification, you may request a private letter ruling 
from the IRS under the guidelines in Revenue Procedure 2020-1, 2020-1 I.R.B. 1 (or 
superseding Revenue Procedure for the year at issue). Note: Certain tax classification 
elections can be requested by filing Form 8832, Entity Classification Election. 
See Form 8832 and its instructions for additional information. 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR S CORPORATION ELECTION: 
If you intend to elect to file your return as a small business corporation, 
an election to file a Form 1120-S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation, 
must be made within certain timeframes and the corporation must meet certain tests. 
All of this information is included in the instructions for Form 2553, Election by 
a Small Business Corporation.
