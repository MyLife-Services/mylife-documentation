Organizational Risks and Challenges

#### Protecting MyLife's Reputation

Placeholder for ideating:

- ai-scams aplenty
- [everything we ward against by being nonprofit goes here]
- member data ownership, and how to secure and potentially securitize (as in shareholder sense for self-earning)
- to address this risk is head-of-curve thinking; right now, tech leaders mostly interested in playing and monetizing, equivalent of scamming from a global utility standpoint
- provides org leg-up in conversation, lays groundwork for UBI
