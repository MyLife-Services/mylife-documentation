Organizational Risks and Challenges

#### Data Breach & Deep Fakes

I combine these two because they represent a loss of integrity and control for organization. Deep fakes could range from I guess fake news of data breach to actual faux layer of interface.

Again, copyright agents would be a valuable asset in uncovering some redundant internet material unless all gateways are similarly blocked by intelligences that block intelligences. Ah, to Avani's thought, this would be a particularly good place for `blockchain` given that the negotiated terms of engagement would need become some public record.

- to address this risk is head-of-curve thinking; right now, tech leaders mostly interested in playing and monetizing, equivalent of scamming from a global utility standpoint
