# MyLife Product/Services Roadmap

Articilate Differences and similarities between MyLife Platform, Products, Services and Milestones
This is wide open to interpretation at this point, but the aim here are to just firehose the lines of development (org or tech) so that we break them into their own priorities and individual roadmaps, to which different volunteers can ally themselves with.[each available for oversight opportunity at many different levels and are most certainly divisible] these can be leasable to organizations or other non-human service providers (meaning internally that a MyLife Member's avatar is the equivalent of a human service provider by proxy so "covered" by our MyLife Avatars, they are an extension of the MyLife System Avatar service)

## MyLife Products

Describe MyLife Products, leasable/saleable AI-enabled solutions for purpose (teams), marketing (experiences), safe self-representation (non-human, or pay-to-play human?), and the API platform technology itself, which is configurable to an ever-increasingly easy degree. Include ideas of eco-and exo systems (eco shares human validations or hosted pipelines on offer with opportunities for humans but are not for-profit by nature, exo then is for-profit and reserach.)

**MyLife Products**

- Bot Teams (customizable, leaseable)
- Experience technology (non-customizable(but "infinite" capacity inside scripting mechanic), leaseable)
- System Avatar (ingrained, no external version?, rethink?)
- MyLife Platform/API technology layer (customizable and leasable and partnership)

I seem to keep forgetting to mention that the reason I keep harping on this last bit for sale is because this is the endpoint arc on how to perform `distributed` architecture. Without central database, everything is vapor, so syncing, repro-ing, backup, regioning, etc need attention soon regardless of saleable intentions. So in other words, yes, everything else is intentionally detachable.

## MyLife Services

- Avatar/Platform protection (from copyright to privacy, security etc protected prophylactically against external digital threat--could lead to how to lease that prophylactic to for-profit leasing...)
- Default Bot Teams (biography, creative, professional, etc as developed, if even originally developed as a Product for remuneration! given type of license we imagine)
- Digital Self
- Posterity storage and vitalized presentation of self and memories
- ... any other bots or bot teams that help develop our sense of person

## MyLife Platform Milestones

These represent milestones that affect business growth and structure and is inclusive of the underlying state of the services, so each phase or milestone will have subordinate evolving business needs (for artifacts or resources) as well as development and maintenance (operational) needs (for MVP (tech-wise) or resources). We are yet to pencil in anything but near-term timelines, but can outline requirements and resources required to achieve.

### Platform Security (Multi-Phase)

Develop and implement a phased approach to enhance the security of the MyLife platform. This includes implementing advanced encryption methods, regular security audits, and developing a robust incident response plan. Each phase will build upon the previous, starting with basic security measures and evolving into a comprehensive, AI-driven security infrastructure designed to protect user data and ensure platform integrity.

#### Phase 1: Hardening Stage (Talc)

We are currently in the hardening stage known as Talc, which involves human-reined and limited system code guardians in GitHub for privacy and security. This phase is intentionally designed to be highly controlled and monitored by human experts to ensure the highest level of initial security, and cataloging of lessons learned since the sheer novelty of the processes involved have no fully standardized (nor will they in a stochastic LLM world) mechanic. The focus is on identifying and addressing immediate vulnerabilities, implementing basic encryption, and setting up initial security protocols as well as defining and incorporating ongoing "post-mortem" learnings.

**Known Security Access Points**

- Azure cloud environment
  - Platform Services app & environments
  - Cosmos/Mongo
  - hard assets tbd
- API Platform infrastructure and authentication routines
  - MyLife API Platform <-> [intelligent] API Consumer (currently frontend)
- LLM transactions
- Fake MyLife accounts and non-human accounts

Overall, we have identified areas of concern

- Establishing secure access controls and authentication mechanisms
- Enhancing general encryption methods to safeguard data both at rest and in transit
- Individual Cryptography: can self-expression be its own passphrase?

In this phase we will also be planning out the roadmap for future securitization phases, which will surely include new definitions and _types_ of security that commingle more dynamically with preferences and consent.

**Project Structure**: Agile coding? Suggestions? probably has 4 or 5 potential arms, from member-privacy to system impenetrability, and correct, that's a wide scope.

#### Phase 2: Harden by Stage

Having the outlined security plan from Phase 1 weighted a) lessons learned and b) green-field ideations, map to initiatives and presume a phased evolving approach to incorporation, with armor as needed given threat landscape.

- Advanced threat detection and response capabilities using AI and machine learning
- Continuous monitoring and analysis of security events and logs
- Automated incident response procedures to swiftly address security breaches.
- Regular updates and patches to ensure the platform remains secure against emerging threats
- Expanding security measures to cover all aspects of the platform, including data storage, processing, and user interactions

#### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement and Adaptation

Security is an ongoing process, and this sustained evolution phase will involve continuous improvement and adaptation of the security measures in place and include detection of external and internal threats.
This phase is likely to include:

- Regularly updating the security infrastructure based on new threats and vulnerabilities
- Conducting ongoing training for the security team to stay ahead of the latest security trends and technologies
- Engaging in regular security drills and simulations to ensure preparedness for potential incidents
- Gathering user feedback to identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall security experience

### Virtual Me/MyLife Avatar (Multi-Phase)

Create and develop a multi-phase Virtual Me/MyLife Avatar system that allows users to interact with a digital representation of themselves. This will include initial setup features, such as avatar creation and customization, and will evolve to incorporate AI-driven interactions, data representation, and the ability to engage with other avatars.

In the later stages of its maturity, the avatar will also embody the capabilities of an Intelligent API Consumer, enabling it to converse directly with other intelligent API avatars. This means the system avatar will not only represent the user within the platform but also interact with external digital entities, facilitating seamless data exchange and communication across various platforms and services. This advanced functionality will ensure a richer, more integrated digital experience for the user.

### Intelligent API Consumer (Ideation Phase)

Initiate the ideation phase for an Intelligent API Consumer by outlining a three-stage connection process with MyLife:

1. **Handshake and Negotiation**:
   - Establish a secure handshake protocol to negotiate conditions, contexts, and the required functionality dependency injections.
   - Ensure that the initial connection sets clear terms for data exchange, including permissions and consent from the user.
   - Integrate functionality to dynamically adjust and accommodate the specific needs of each interaction based on predefined and user-specific conditions.

2. **Command-Driven Experience**:
   - Develop a command-driven experience where the connecting avatar interacts with MyLife's server.
   - The avatar must portray content received from the server in event sequences, providing appropriate feedback to the underlying human.
   - Ensure that the interaction process is smooth and intuitive, allowing the user to guide the flow of information and make real-time adjustments.
   - Continuously process and adapt based on the feedback from the user to ensure the experience aligns with their expectations and consent.
   - Ensures the underlying human guardrails have value - example: it is your memory being portrayed in 3 discrete dynamic exchanges, _you_ have determined the underlying content and the degree to which your voice and your "painting" (in jpegs, video, audio, 3d, +++) must be faithfully represented in this exchange. You get to paint in the shape of your own portraiture _just_ by engaging with MyLife.

3. **Contract Conclusion**:
   - Once the event sequence is completed, confirm that the handshake contract has been fulfilled.
   - Ensure that all data generated during the interaction is stored according to the agreed-upon consent and negotiation terms.
   - Implement secure storage solutions and ensure that data is easily retrievable for future use, analysis, or modification.

### Near-Term Expectations

Given that intelligent avatars of this sophistication are not yet available, the following steps will help shape the industry and embed this process in code:

1. **Generate Articles and White Papers**:
   - Write and publish articles and white papers to shape industry standards and expectations.
   - Focus on the potential benefits, ethical considerations, and technical challenges of implementing intelligent API consumers.
   - Share insights on the ideation process, anticipated use cases, and the expected evolution of intelligent avatars.

2. **Develop Tutorials and Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive tutorials and documentation to guide developers through the process of implementing intelligent API consumers.
   - Include step-by-step instructions on setting up the handshake protocol, managing command-driven interactions, and confirming handshake fulfillment.
   - Provide examples and use cases to illustrate the practical applications of this technology.

3. **Sequence-Based Interchange**:
   - Start with simpler applications of sequence-based interchange, such as reliving memories and other structured interactions.
   - Use these initial applications as test cases to refine the technology and gather user feedback.
   - Gradually expand the scope and complexity of the interactions as the technology matures and becomes more sophisticated.

By following this approach, MyLife can lead the development of intelligent API consumers, paving the way for future advancements in this field. This phased approach will ensure that the technology is robust, user-friendly, and aligned with industry standards and ethical considerations.
