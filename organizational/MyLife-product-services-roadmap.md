# MyLife Product/Services Roadmap

## MyLife Productized Lines

This is wide open to interpretation at this point, but the aim here are to just firehose the lines of development (org or tech) so that we break them into their own priorities and individual roadmaps, to which different volunteers can ally themselves with.

Platform Security (multi-phase)
Virtual Me/MyLife Avatar (multi-phase)
Intelligent API Consumer (ideation)
Immediate expansion of Data Input Tools (development)
Alpha UI Optimization
Mobile optimization
Direct Avatar access (member-to-member, public/private?)
Bot Teams for different functions/services
Bot Team development
Experience Technology
Platform deployability to 3rd parties (multi-phase)
Moderated Panel
Relationship Manager

- Custom MyLife Platform Deployability to (org) consumer customers
- Digital Self/Self-Avatar functionality
- Scrapbook (as example, iterator/collection management improved mechanics)
- Flat assets: regards static files not currently subject to LLM/platform assessment or manipulation (presume one day, but example: the difference between storing a photograph and analyzing it for people in it, location, etc., think _metadata_); shouldn't necessarily include how to display or functionalize these flat elements, only how to find destination (suggest Permanent.org as candidate)
- Product/Service Team Buildout
  - Memory/Memoir Team
  - Volunteer Team
  - Creative Team
  - Health Team
  - Professional Team
  - ...list long as arm?
- Security/Securitization at platform level
- Front-end architecture and development in AI-First (and -Last) framework
- Consent Engine
- Evolution Agent
  - This is an intelligence that looks after the maturation and _timescales_ of the member data-structures
  - It seeks to understand your patterns over time and seeks to expand information-sets by entreating the member to investigate, flesh out and dimensionalize aspects of themselves (spirituality more, artistic innovation, creative inspiration, etc.) 
  - Simplest version? You only have two pieces of data about childhood. Let's fill that in. The Evolution Agent would be the one on the lookout for this, as a subcomponent of the Avatar (also 1-to-1) but a debatably necessary part of the successful MyLife equation
  - It is also responsible for managing a user's account post-mortem in conjunction with your avatar

## MyLife Milestones

These represent milestones that affect business growth and structure and is inclusive of the underlying state of the services, so each phase or milestone will have subordinate evolving business needs (for artifacts or resources) as well as development and maintenance (operational) needs (for MVP (tech-wise) or resources). We are yet to pencil in anything but near-term timelines, but can outline requirements and resources required to achieve.

Alpha Pilot
Wide Alpha Release(s)
Beta Test
- Volunteer Launch (?) - internal->external celebration (i.e., limited public release)
