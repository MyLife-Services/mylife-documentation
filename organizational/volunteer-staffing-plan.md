# Volunteer and Staffing Plan

## MyLife Volunteerism

Even at its core, as one can infer from much of the organizational documentation and the articulation of its vision and principles, MyLife values any contribution of self. Something as simple as sharing a memory with posterity is considered an exceptional gift. This belief underpins our commitment to preserving and celebrating individual experiences, which collectively contribute to the tapestry of human history.

There are currently a number of ways, albeit too few at the moment, for people to contribute financially to help realize this vision. From SK-codes to generous contributions through standard models, MyLife aims to expand gifting opportunities, both for the organization and individuals across the globe, within the platform. The goal is to implement smart and innovative initiatives that broaden the scope and impact of donations. Implementable ideas range from sponsorships of the organization and individuals to token-based gifting systems. Introducing token-based gifting would allow members to earn tokens through platform engagement, which can then be donated to support MyLife's projects or other members in need. Additionally, avatar-facilitated direct-anonymous-target identification could enable members to identify and support specific causes or individuals anonymously, preserving privacy while fostering generosity.

This document is dedicated to those who give their time to directly support the organization. We thank you for the effort you have placed or are interested in engaging in to ideate and assist in realizing technology that **works for all of us**. Your dedication helps us advance our mission of ensuring digital dignity, equity, and justice for every individual, making a lasting impact on humanity.

### Current process

This is something of a checklist on how we've been going about stirring interest in MyLife. First off, we have a great deal of offer to most candidates out there. MyLife is an AI-first platform in development and is public-access and opensource. Together this means that we can give volunteers the education, awareness, and literal hands-on experience in solving problems in an AI-first project. GitHub tickets solved, demonstrable ai experience for future employers, keeping up with trends, giving back to society, it's all transparently on the docket.

So we've found LinkedIn (free version for now) to be so successful that we realize we will need a layer of expert managerial skills in a volunteer coordinator, to move forward acquiring resources even alone in this way.
