# Volunteer and Staffing Plan

## MyLife Volunteerism

Even at it's core, as one could infer from a lot of the organizational documentation and in the animation of its vision and principles, MyLife observes _any_ contribution of self, even something as simple as the act of sharing a memory with posterity, as an exceptional gift. 

Dreictly give make lives better: SK-codes, generous contirbutions, standard models, all pointing to a potential UBI reality that we'd been discussing for a year, and don't mind Musk stealing our thunder on this particular matter. but also we aim to innovate IN-PLATFORM models for giving that we've likely never seen before--that's the underlying nature and power of AI.

Then there are those who will give of their time to directly support the organization. That's what this document is about. Thanking you for the effort you've placed or are interested in engaging in order ideate and assist _realizing_ technology that **works for all of us**.

By humans (and AI) _for_ humans (and _not_ the AI... get your _own_ platform, bub! [kisses, love you!]).

## Opportunity

MyLife is always evolving as it represents what we, _humanity,_ want to build for ourselves and extend that invitation for the same, to any human who would have affinity with our mission and ethos and therefore have interest in supporting the services we offer.

The opporunities inside and outside of such a platform as MyLife will only become more interesting and more vast. Humans will not only _get_ to pursue productivity as their interests and whims see fit, we will be defined by that which we _choose_ to pursue.
