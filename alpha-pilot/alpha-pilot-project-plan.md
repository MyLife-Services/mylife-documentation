### About the Alpha Pilot Project

The Alpha version of the MyLife Member Services Platform is designed to be the foundational step towards achieving our mission. This initial release focuses on capturing and preserving our living stories, wisdom, and beliefs for posterity. The Alpha version includes the development of the core functionalities necessary to collect, curate, and store personal media, providing a seamless user experience for members to create their digital legacies.

## Alpha Pilot Milestone

### Goal

This top-level milestone represents the state where MyLife platform's core features are developed internally and tested by external initial Pilot Members. This is currently arranged as a Project in GitHub [MyLife Pilot Alpha Build](https://github.com/orgs/MyLife-Services/projects/13).  

Against this project, we articulate this milestone to represent a completed MVP that has been tested and reviewed by a core group of alpha member testers. This milestone is also managed inside of our open-source GitHub environment: [MyLife Alpha Pilot Milestone](https://github.com/MyLife-Services/mylife-maht/milestone/22).
