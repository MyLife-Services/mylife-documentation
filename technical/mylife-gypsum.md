## Gypsum Overview

This document is the roadmap for developing increasing security for the MyLife along known and burgeoning vectors. We intend to be more comprehensive in our initial approach than exclusive as real-time threats and concerns emerge. This is not to be confused with our [Risk Management documentation](), which is geared towards detecting threats and then, when appropriate, feed a strategic solution into this `Gypsum` security roadmap.

**Why Gypsum?**

Nodding to Moh's scale of hardness, we recognize that we have a long way to go to ensure  our membership, essentially _ourselves_, the protections we need from our mother-natural environs and our semi-inchoate collectivizing, essentially _ourselves_. Our attempt is to be able to see us coming, and predict how and why we should best react. As we collectively get defter at dodgeballing our way to a brighter future, we have the privilege of moving up the scale.

Yay, us! (read as sarcastically as you personally prefer... I vacillate.)

## Roadmap

At the moment this is a straw document comprised of suggestions from Q and myself, and considered in no way to be accurately structured nor complete.

## Database Security

- **Data Access Control**: Implement strict access control mechanisms, role-based access, and least privilege policies.
- **Encryption**: Ensure data at rest and in transit is encrypted using strong algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
- **Backup Security**: Secure backups using encryption and ensure they are stored in off-site locations.
- **Data Masking**: Use data masking techniques for non-production environments to prevent exposure of sensitive data.
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: Implement logging of access and transactions for auditing purposes.

## Platform Security

- application security
- codebase security
- network security
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) and ensure proper identity management (OAuth, SAML, etc.).
- **Patch Management**: Regularly update software, firmware, and operating systems to protect against vulnerabilities.
- **Secure API Access**: Use API security measures like rate limiting, authentication tokens, and input validation.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**: Implement IDS/IPS systems to detect and block malicious activities.
- **Cloud Security**: Use cloud-native security tools (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure Security Center) and implement strong governance policies for cloud platforms.

## Member Security

- **Password Management**: Enforce the use of password managers and strong password policies.
- **Endpoint Protection**: Ensure all user endpoints are protected using antivirus, anti-malware, and endpoint detection tools.
- doxxing

## Compliance and Governance

- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, HIPAA) and government regulations.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed audit trails for all systems and processes to demonstrate compliance.
- **Policy Management**: Develop and enforce security policies related to data handling, privacy, and user access.

## Supply Chain/Partnership Security

- **Vendor Risk Management**: Assess and monitor third-party vendors to ensure their security practices align with your standards.
- **Supply Chain Integrity**: Use security checks at various points of the supply chain to prevent the introduction of malicious components.

## Economic Security

- **Fraud Detection**: Use machine learning models to detect anomalies in transactions and prevent fraud.
- **Financial Auditing**: Regular financial audits should be performed to verify the accuracy and integrity of financial records.
- **Transaction Security**: Secure all financial transactions using SSL/TLS encryption and tokenization where applicable.
- **Business Continuity**: Develop and maintain a business continuity plan to ensure economic resilience during disruptions.

## Reputation Security

- **Brand Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring of the organizationâ€™s brand on social media, news, and other public forums.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Establish a communication strategy for managing public relations in case of a security incident.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR or CCPA to avoid legal and reputational damage from data breaches.
- **Customer Trust and Transparency**: Build trust by regularly updating customers on security measures, incident responses, and compliance.

## Physical Security

- **Access Controls**: Use biometrics, key cards, and physical security for data centers and critical infrastructure.
- **Surveillance Systems**: Ensure video monitoring is in place for sensitive locations, with access logs and monitoring for entry points.
- **Disaster Recovery Sites**: Establish off-site disaster recovery sites and secure them physically and digitally.

## Personnel Security

- onboarding
- **Security Training**: Conduct regular security awareness training for employees on phishing, social engineering, and password hygiene.
- **Insider Threat Management**: Implement mechanisms to detect insider threats, including behavior analytics and monitoring.
- **Background Checks**: Perform thorough background checks on employees with access to critical systems.

## Device Security

- **Device Authentication**: Ensure all connected devices are authenticated and securely configured.
- **Network Segmentation**: Segregate IoT devices from critical systems through VLANs and firewalls.
- **Patch Management**: Update firmware and software regularly for all IoT devices.
