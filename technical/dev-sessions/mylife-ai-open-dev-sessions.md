## About MyLife

Hello and welcome to the MyLife Open Dev Sessions exciting new `Diary Bot Series`

I'm Erik Jespersen, president, co-founder and currently the senior architect and lone developer. Looking to change that and hoping to get you interested in what AI can do for you and for all of us.

Thanks so much for joining me today, I hope you find this valuable. If you do, I'll invite you at the end to help collaborate on this epic project.

MyLife is a 501c3 nonprofit member organization that offers its membership an intelligent platform that helps them tell and preserve their cherished memories, stories, media, and ideas for posterity, and allows them to experience past human narratives. Good news, membership is free to any humans, but only; no corporations, no ai's, no fictional characters. Our intelligent platform is built by humans for humans. And that's a bit of what we're here to talk about. What does it mean: AI for all of us?

## About MyLife Platform

MyLife guides you through the journey of crafting and sharing your digital self and digital legacy with posterity.

Let's take a look at this slide for a moment, it's a complex jumble, but I just want to share with you what you get when you become a member of MyLife.

explain graphic in sentence coding holes and top/bottom

First you get a personal member avatar. This is an intelligence that essentially _is_ your MyLife Account. It is a digital intelligence that is meant to interact with you _and_ when invited and consented, digitally act _as_ you sharing your selected content with others as you consent.

So you get this avatar, and then you get its ability to control an out-of-the-box team of bot intelligences called the 'Memory Team' that helps you collect, enhance, improve, relive and share your cherished memories, ideas and narratives for posterity.

MyLife, as a technology, is an open-source headless, intelligent api platform server, leveraging minimal opensource javascript server frameworks. MyLife currently uses the OpenAI SDK for all of its LLM services, but the larger aim is to be model agnostic, being an aggregator, the likes of which many of you have already seen on the market.

The frontend is currently a "work-in-progress" and in need of much improvement (I'll talk more about getting involved later). It represents a relatively minimalistic visual interface for our membership to interact with the intelligent platform. MyLife's aim is to afford its avatars with the ability to self-generate their user-interfaces in entirety on-command of login. We're a ways off from that, but it's a circular process of intelligent host speaks to intelligent client comin' o'er the Rye.

With that caveat, and a call out to designers, Let's take a look!

### Asides

#### Avatar Marketplace

Some of these Replikas, You, but Virtual solutions are currently coming on the market, but none missioned to provide you secure, protected data privacy and ownership. That's one tiny way in which MyLife is different.

There are objects coming on the marketplace that offer this intention, Replika, Digital You, I'm sure you're seeing a lot of these already that are curios for the moment, but the Big Tech understands the results of this bonding with a digital entity is the only valuable data it has to mine, since they exist and are in situ to exploit our attention rather than elevate it. You will be offered many suits of armor, and it is in MyLife's interests and direction to partner with the those similarly missioned.

The frontend itself currently is a combination of HTML5, CSS and javascript. It is endeavoring upon emerging GenUI principles of _Consent and Control_ architecture, so that a frontend intelligence can negotiate an array of interactional experiences with an intelligent API service. We'll get more into that in the coming months, though I'll shortly show an example of this.

It was wonderful to talk with Steve and walk through the presentation. He's on the board of MyLife also. My wife ran out to grab some lunch just after we played Frisbee with Bryn -- she's a rescue just a 5 years old this December and the best at Frisbee you'll see! I had a delicious Banh Mi, it was delicious, but didn't help my nervousness. The AI development session is going to begin in just a few minutes. Zoinks! Please save this memory.

### 20240830

- Initial live version

#### 20240830 Outline

- Brief introduction to the MyLife Platform **MAX** _5m_ @2:05pm
  - Introduce Self, current president and co-founder
  - Introduce MyLife (mission `slide`) [click here to access content](#about-mylife)
  - Introduce MyLife Tech (what MyLife is `slide`)
  - Introduce Session, Theme and Segue: AI for All of Us (engineering and interface `slides`)
    - The MyLife AI Open Dev Sessions are about empowering all of us with the ability to create solutions that matter to humanity--"By Humanity, for humanity." The type of network the internet promised, but the work required to execute and deliver on this promise fell to workhorses intent on corporatizing the internet. Largely successful.
    - MyLife and these sessions are AI for All of Us
    - We've been thinking for years now about the values and philosophies _behind_ MyLife, its organizational structure and what we can offer and afford one another when we put our technology to the test, and we've been passionate about consent, digital dignity, digital equity and justice--all of which baked into our basic mission and illuminated in the intelligent software platform we developed. Setting ourselves on this journey to design a system around the idea of "AI for All of Us", I'm so excited and happy to be able to share with you our lessons learned and our lessons _learning_, that we bring to the platform, to our members and to you.
  - Demo
    - I need to save a new memory: I woke up this morning 20240830 and had some coffee and helped the contractors and then I prepared for a mylife open dev session in zoom. Got a Lyft ride from a very nice driver who brought me to Delphine's that was far too crowded so I opted for some corner pizza (which has changed hands) instead; it was okay, but not the sort of crust I most enjoy, but the counter cooks were nice. Then I went to the library to almost intrude on another meeting in the Fogg room, and now I am sitting upstairs at the Beverly Library waiting to get into the Open Dev Session at 1:45pm ET; do I even have time to be nervous? please create that and save it

## Appendix

### Empowerment Through Technology

- **AI for the People**: MyLife stands as a beacon for the ethical use of AI, designed to empower individuals and organizations, not just with technological prowess, but with the tools to make meaningful decisions that positively impact lives.
- **Human-Centered AI**: MyLife AI isn’t just a tool; it’s an extension of human potential. Our bots, data services, and APIs are designed with one goal in mind: enhancing the capacity of individuals to manage, understand, and grow in their personal and professional lives.
- **Accessible Tools for All**: We believe that everyone should have access to the most powerful tools available, from individuals managing their own lives to corporations handling vast datasets. The MyLife platform levels the playing field, giving small-scale contributors access to the same advanced AI that powers the world's largest organizations.
- **Volunteer-Driven, Mission-Focused**: MyLife’s foundation lies in its dedicated volunteer team, a global community committed to creating AI solutions that serve the greater good. Their work isn’t driven by profit but by a shared vision of technology that uplifts humanity. This gives every contribution greater meaning and ensures that integrity remains at the forefront of our mission.
- **Contributing to Something Greater**: Every contribution to MyLife isn’t just about code; it’s about building a system that empowers others. By contributing to our platform, developers and volunteers are helping shape a future where people can use AI to navigate complex corporate landscapes, make informed decisions, and improve their quality of life.
- **Integrity as a Guide**: MyLife embodies the belief that empowerment without integrity is hollow. Through our platform, users gain the power to shape their future while being guided by principles that ensure their actions have a positive impact. This aligns with the larger mission of MyLife to not only create powerful AI solutions but to ensure these solutions are used in ways that foster trust, compassion, and responsibility.

#### Quotes

- Maht: Our work is like a puzzle, where each piece—whether it’s a single line of code or a new instruction set—helps complete a picture of human empowerment
- Maht: Empowerment isn’t about giving someone power over others—it’s about helping them harness their power for one's betterment and the greater good, driven by integrity and a sense of purpose
